This game is for two players, one of them has to input a word (only one word, and only characters a-z) and the other one have to guess the word his opponent input.
He will see some underlines, each of them respresenting a letter from the guessing word. Each time he press a button and the word contains that letter, it will show up on the screen. Winning condition is to guess all letters before sixth mistake, otherwise...you are hanged! :(
